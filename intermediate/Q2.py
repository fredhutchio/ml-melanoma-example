# # Overview
# 
# This is the __intermediate level__ version of [question 2](../novice/Q2.ipynb) from the novice level. Previously we focused on the different type of plots and simple counting. This notebook focuses on conditional probability by using some of the features in the descriptions files to come up with a probabilty that a patient has a malignant lesion. The question we are trying to answer is who are the most at risk groups based on demographic (coming from the joint distribution)?

# Here we need to identify which columns we need for our analysis, then create a dataframe from data. <br>
# Some of the columns from the description file are not going to be used (We remove the columns that we don't need, using *pandas.DataFrame.drop()*)

# ### Below is the only function we will need for our analysis. Given a patient's Age, Site, and Sex we find the probability of them having a malignant lesion.
# Since malignancy is independent we can use: **P(A|B)=P(Aâˆ©B)P(B)** <br>
# Where A is Malignant and B is the combined probability of age, sex, and site.
# 
# P("Malignant"| "Age", "Site", "Sex") = P("Malignant" * "Age" * "Site" * "Sex") / P("Age" * "Site" * "Sex")

# In[5]:






# Here we get all of the different combinations we need for our visualizations: <br>
# Age <br>
# Sex <br>
# Site

# In[40]:


# Some of the sites are wrong, and ages are out of order so we need to do some preprocessing on the data.

# In[41]:




# Next we need to find the probability of a having a malignant lesion given a patient's age, sex, and lesion location <br>
# Then we need to separate all of the patients into two groups: female & male

# ### Risk of having a malignant lesion for males

# For the case when malignancy is dependent:
# **M** = Malignant,
# **A** = Age,
# **S** = Sex,
# **T** = Site <br>
# P(M|A,S,T) = P(M|W,T) <br>
# P(M|W,T) = P(M|Z) <br>
# P(M|Z) = P(M n Z) / P(Z) <br>
# 
# P(M n Z) / P(Z) = P(M n (W n T)) / P(W n T) <br>
# P(M n W n T) / P(W n T) <br>
# P(W n T) = P(W) * P(T|W) <br>
# 
# P(W) = P(A n S) <br>
# P(T|W) = P(T n W) / P(W) <br>
# P(T n W) = P(T n (A n S)) <br>
