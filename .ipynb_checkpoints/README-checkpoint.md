# This is the tutorial focused on solving research questions regarding the melenoma lesions dataset.

## Research questions are split into three categories based on level of interest and skill.

### Beginner (basic stats and visualization):
1. Does coloration (as simply as can be extracted) correlate with malignancy somehow? 
2. Whether malignant lesions occur more along some gender or age line? 
3. What is the essential frequency distribution of lesion diagnosis? Is it skewed (overall and within categories)? 
Potential techniques to apply: scatter plots, bar charts, etc.

### Intermediate (conditional probability and A/B Testing): 
1. Some sort of A/B testing or difference-between-groups testing after categorizing by coloration of image
2. Risk prediction based on demographic (coming from the joint distribution)?
3. Clustering/Categorization with only part of the data

### Expert: 
1. Is a sample Benign or malignant (image classification)?
Note: we may add preprocessing steps like spatial transformer/zoom operation/color processing
2. Can you predict the gender/age of a person from a sample (multiple linear regression)?
3. Clustering/categorization that hopefully lines up with their lesion diagnosis or the lesion diagnosis frequency chart from the beginner section.
